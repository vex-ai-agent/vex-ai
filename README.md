## 🧠 What is VEX?

**VEX** is an AI-powered Solana Agent built to interface with the blockchain using natural language commands. It supports real-time operations like wallet generation, price checking, and smart transaction execution.

> VEX is not a chatbot.  
> It's a command interface to the Solana machine.

VEX parses your natural language input using OpenAI, then matches it to blockchain operations through the Solana Agent Kit SDK. It can generate wallets, check token prices, and initiate transactions — all via a terminal-style AI chat.
